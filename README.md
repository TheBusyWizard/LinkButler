# **LinkButler**
#### A client-side, offline-first web app for managing, sorting, searching, and tagging absurd numbers of links.

This was born to help me manage my rather large collection of URLs and saved tabs ( ~30,000 ) that I had collected over the years.  Between bookmarks, hidden tabs, and various "save for later" tools, the collection had grown quite unmanageable.
